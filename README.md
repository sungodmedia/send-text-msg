# Send Text Message

This application sends a text message using the Twillo API. 


It is not an example of my best work, but of my ability to learn quickly. I had 5 days to complete the task. 


When given, I did not have any experience with Ruby, Rails, Git, Twillo, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap or Heroku. I developed and deployed the application in 5 days, passing the challenge.


The code here is raw, unchanged since submission. 

Please refer to my other repositories for current example code.
